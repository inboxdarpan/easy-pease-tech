Tools and technologies explained, easy peasy lemon squeezy

I have always wondered why do we make software engineering so hard. At times it is already hard. I remember making comments like 'can you explain it in English?' or 'can you make it more noob-friendly' because all the jargons were too much to digest and learning about what a tool or piece of technology does is very hard to understand.

So I decided to bring this change in the world, explaining technology and tools in an easy language, making it noob-friendly, one tool at a time.
